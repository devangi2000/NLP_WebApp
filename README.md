A web application made using common libraries employed for NLP tasks such as [Gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/auto_examples/index.html), [SpaCy](https://spacy.io/api/doc) and [Sumy](https://github.com/miso-belica/sumy) that essentially summarizes long text documents, analyzes the docs for named entities as well as checks URLs. [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/), a library that one can utilise to deploy ML web applications quickly and easily, has been used here.
